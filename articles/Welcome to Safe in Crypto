Welcome to Safe in Web3: Honest Crypto Education That Protects You
Why I'm Here (And Why You Should Be Too)
In December 2025, the Trust Wallet browser extension was compromised. $7 million vanished from users' wallets on Christmas Eve. Families woke up to find their savings gone – stolen when an unauthorized and malicious version of the Trust Wallet Browser Extension (version 2.68) was published to the Chrome web-browser.
This wasn't an isolated incident. It was the reality of cryptocurrency scams in 2025 and it will be going forward.
Pig butchering scams alone stole $4 Billion to $6 billion in 2024. AI-powered deep-fakes are mimicking celebrities to promote fake crypto "giveaways." WhatsApp investment clubs are convincing people to pour money into platforms that vanish overnight. According to the FBI, $240 million was lost to cryptocurrency ATM scams in the first six months of 2025, about double the pace of similar scams in 2024.
And here's what really gets to me: Most of these losses were completely preventable.
The victims weren't careless or stupid. They were mostly beginners – people exploring crypto for the first time, trying to understand this revolutionary technology, and walking straight into traps because no one gave them honest guidance.
That's why I'm starting this publication.
My Story: From Developer to Crypto Educator
I'm Horward Muyuni, and I've spent the last 15 years building software systems, APIs and mobile solutions across my native country Zambia. I've integrated payment gateways for mobile network operators. I've documented complex systems for some top engineering, educational and private-sector institutions. I've turned technical chaos into clear, usable products.
But in 2021, I dove deep into the world of cryptocurrency. But I need to be honest with you about why.
What I found after a few experiences shocked me.
For every legitimate use case, there are at least ten or more scams. For every honest educator, there are a hundred "crypto gurus" promising the moon. The crypto space was – and still is – designed to confuse newcomers and separate them from earning an honest and profitable livelihood.
I wasn't some visionary who saw the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). I was desperate. Yes, you heard that right.
COVID-19 had just torn through my household. The medical bills were crushing – expensive medications, treatments, oxygen. In Zambia, there was little government support. We paid for everything out of pocket. As expected, my savings evaporated almost overnight.
I was in debt and I was broke. At this point I was looking for a way out.
That's when I found crypto. Attracted not by the innovation, but drawn by the promises. The get-rich-quick stories; the testimonials of people who turned $100 into $10,000 overnight; and the "gurus" showing screenshots of massive gains with little investment.
I needed those promises to be true. So I believed them.
And I lost money. Not once but multiple times. Different scams, same devastating feeling each time – that sinking realization when you know you've been fooled. When you watch your transaction go through and suddenly understand it's never coming back. When you're staring at an empty wallet, feeling stupid and ashamed.
I'm not writing this from an ivory tower. I've felt exactly what you might be feeling right now – or what you're afraid of feeling. That sick knot in your stomach. That anger at yourself. That desperate hope that maybe, somehow, you can get the money back.
You can't. I didn't. That money is gone.
Let me give you just one example: While scrolling through my telegram account I saw an Airdrop opportunity and it looked legit. The usual DYOR (Do Your Own Research) messages were splashed all over. And a direct warning that “you should not pay anything to receive tokens to your wallet” was prominently placed. It was authentic. An airdrop warning about scams! This must be legit! So I participated. All I needed to do was to join two of their telegram groups. One group was where “Proof of payment” messages were being posted and the other was a chat group. After satisfying the conditions, I hit the “withdraw” button.
I received 4,000 NOBU tokens on the Binance Smart Chain into my Trust Wallet. At the end of the airdrop, the scammers even provided a website for swapping these tokens into USDT or BNB. All I had to do was pay a $6 gas fee which is a normal thing in crypto.
I paid the $6. The swap never happened. I didn’t get my USDT or BNB equivalent of my 4,000 NOBU tokens. I must mention here that before I swapped, and since I was running the swap page using the browser of my Trust Wallet, the wallet warned me of a possible “honeypot” but I ignored it largely because of the “proofs of payment”. Now, a honeypot crypto scam involves a malicious code in the contract agreement (CA) or smart contract that restricts which addresses can transfer its token. Maybe this is why some addresses were receiving while others were scammed.
Instead, I got a message: "Send $3 more."
That's when it clicked and immediately realized I'd just paid scammers $6 to learn what a dusting attack looks like. Those 4,000 NOBU tokens are still sitting in my wallet. Useless. Unswappable. A permanent reminder that even when you think you're being careful, scammers are always one step ahead.
I have six to ten examples of tokens like this in my wallet. Tokens I can't swap. Money I can't recover. Each one cost me something – $6 here, $20 there, sometimes even more. These are small amounts that add up to something substantial. Small lessons that compound into expensive education. Every time I open my Trust Wallet, I scroll past those tokens looking at 4,000 NOBU, 10,000 of some other coin and 5,000 of another. Each one is a little monument to my expensive education. I keep them there on purpose now – they keep me honest, skeptical and keep me from ever thinking ‘this time might be different’.
But here's what I gained though: knowledge. Painful, expensive knowledge about how these scams work. About the psychological triggers they exploit. About why smart, careful people – people like you and me – still fall for them especially when we're vulnerable.
I studied every scam that took my money. I analyzed the patterns. I learned to spot the red flags I'd missed. Not because I'm some crypto genius, but because I refused to let those losses be meaningless. If I was going to lose money learning these lessons, at least I could help others avoid paying the same tuition.
I watched friends lose thousands to the same traps I'd fallen into. I saw elderly relatives targeted by pig butchering schemes. I witnessed the Trust Wallet hack drain millions from people who thought they were being careful – just like I thought I was being careful.
Each time, I thought: "This didn't have to happen. I could have warned them."
So I started writing. First on Medium, and now I am expanding to other platforms such as substack.com. In my articles, I focus on one thing: protecting crypto beginners from the predatory side of Web3.
Not teaching them how to get rich. Not promoting the next hot token. Just honest, practical guidance on navigating the crypto world safely.
The lack of more louder voices to warn crypto newcomers out there is what made me realize that this needed to be more than occasional articles here and there. It needed to be a consistent, reliable source of honest crypto education cutting through the hype.
This Substack is that source.
What You'll Get Here
I'm not going to sugarcoat it: The crypto space is dangerous for beginners. But it's also full of genuine innovation and opportunity – if you know how to navigate safely.
This publication will help you do exactly that.
Here's What to Expect:
Every Tuesday & Friday, you'll receive:
Scam Alerts & Analysis
•	Current threats targeting crypto newcomers
•	Real examples of recent scams (like the Trust Wallet hack)
•	Specific red flags to watch for
•	Practical protection strategies
Beginner-Friendly Education
•	Blockchain basics without the jargon
•	Wallet security (custodial, non-custodial, hardware, software)
•	How to verify transactions and smart contracts
•	DApp safety and DeFi fundamentals
•	Mobile-first crypto guidance for emerging markets
Honest Guidance Over Hype
•	No "guaranteed returns" or get-rich-quick schemes
•	No promotion of specific tokens or projects
•	Just practical advice backed by technical expertise and real-world experience
Why Now?
Because the gap between crypto hype and crypto reality has never been wider.
Mainstream adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin ETFs launched in 2024. Major institutions are entering the space. More everyday people are exploring cryptocurrency than ever before.
And scammers know it.
They're getting more sophisticated. AI deep-fakes. Social engineering attacks that target even major platforms like Coinbase. Fake DApps that look identical to legitimate ones. Rug pulls disguised as revolutionary projects.
Beginners need protection more than ever. They need someone who:
•	Has the technical depth to understand what's actually happening
•	Has been active in crypto long enough to spot the patterns
•	Cares more about keeping you safe than making a quick buck
•	Can explain complex concepts without drowning you in jargon
•	And perhaps someone who writes from experience not just research.
That's what I bring to this publication.
What Makes This Different?
I'm not trying to sell you anything except knowledge.
I don't have a course to promote. I'm not shilling tokens. I'm not running a Discord group with "exclusive signals." I'm not affiliated with any exchange or project.
My only agenda: Keep you safe while you explore cryptocurrency.
I combine: 
•	12 years of technical expertise (software development, API integration, mobile systems) 
•	4 years active in crypto (DeFi, wallets, DApps, real hands-on experience) 
•	Deep scam awareness (I study fraud tactics like a security researcher) 
•	Clear, jargon-free writing (I translate complex tech for everyday people) 
•	Mobile-first, emerging markets focus (solutions that work in real-world conditions)
Most crypto educators are either:
•	Technical experts who can't explain things clearly
•	Marketers who prioritize hype over honesty
•	Influencers who profit from promoting projects
I'm none of those. I'm a technical writer who believes crypto's potential is too important to let scammers ruin it for everyone.
