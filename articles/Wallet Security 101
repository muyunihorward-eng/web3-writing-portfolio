Wallet Security 101: What Legitimate Services NEVER Ask For
If anyone – ANYONE – asks for your seed phrase, it’s a scam. No exceptions. Here’s what else they’ll try...
The 0.5 ETH That Never Was
It was 2021. I was just getting into crypto and looking forward to making a buck or two. I was looking for any way to rebuild my financial wasteland.
Scrolling through my Telegram account, I discovered a crypto-mining bot promising free Ethereum. It seemed simple and straight forward: join their bot and five related channels, “mine” ETH by clicking buttons and completing tasks. They even had a “proof of payment” channel showing other users’ successful withdrawals with transaction IDs on the blockchain.
Red flag: The “proof of payment” channel. But I was desperate. I ignored it.
Within a week, I had “mined” 0.5 ETH. At 2021 prices, that was real money – money I desperately needed. The bot notified me: “You’re now authorized to withdraw your proceeds.”
I hit “Withdraw.”
Then the message appeared:
“To process your withdrawal, send 0.005 ETH to this address for gas fees. Or, for faster processing, you can send us your seed phrase and we’ll handle the transaction directly.”
My mind went to war with itself.
On one hand: I needed that money. The transaction IDs in the “proof of payment” channel looked legitimate. Other people were supposedly getting paid. Maybe it was real?
On the other hand, I’d just spent weeks reading Trust Wallet’s support documentation. One thing was drilled into me repeatedly: NEVER give your seed phrase to anyone. Not even Trust Wallet themselves.
The temptation was crushing. 0.5 ETH. Right there. All I had to do was either:
•	Send 0.005 ETH (about $20 at the time) for “gas fees”
•	Or just give them my seed phrase and they’d “handle it”
But something felt wrong.
Why would they need my seed phrase to send ME money? Why was there a “faster processing” option that required giving up complete control of my wallet? Why the pressure to choose quickly?
I didn’t send the ETH. I didn’t share my seed phrase.
Instead, I investigated. I checked the “proof of payment” transactions more carefully. I searched for the bot’s name with “scam” added. I asked in legitimate crypto forums.
The truth hit hard.
The entire operation was fake. The “proof of payment” channel? Fabricated transactions or stolen transaction IDs from real transfers. The 0.5 ETH I “mined”? Never existed. It was just numbers in a bot interface with no actual blockchain record. If I’d sent the 0.005 ETH, I’d have lost it – and received nothing in return. If I’d sent my seed phrase, they’d have drained my wallet of everything I actually had. Either way, I was going to lose. The only reason I didn’t? One simple rule I’d memorized from Trust Wallet’s documentation:
Real crypto services NEVER ask for your seed phrase. Ever. For any reason. This one rule saved me.
But here’s the thing: I almost fell for it anyway.
I wasn’t careless, rush or stupid. I was desperate, hopeful, and relatively new. The scam was sophisticated. The “proof” looked real. The opportunity felt legitimate.
That’s how these scams work. They exploit hope and desperation, not ignorance.
Telegram is awash with these bots. This is not to say Telegram is bad. It is actually one place one could earn some ‘free’ crypto. There are legit bots but for every legit bot, there are 20 or 30 counterfeit ones. They promise free crypto, mining rewards, airdrops, giveaways and the only requirement is either:
•	An upfront “processing fee”
•	Or your seed phrase for “direct deposit”
I got lucky. I had just enough knowledge to resist just enough temptation. But I have 6-10 other tokens sitting in my wallet right now from scams I DID fall for. Each one cost me something. Each one taught me something. 
This article is your shortcut past all those expensive lessons I went through.
You’ll learn exactly what legitimate services ask for, what they NEVER ask for, and how to spot every variation of this scam before it costs you money.
The Core Truth: Your Seed Phrase IS Your Money
Before we go further, you need to understand what a seed phrase actually is.
Your seed phrase is NOT:
•	A password you can change
•	A backup of your wallet
•	Something support might need to help you
•	Information that unlocks specific features
Your seed phrase IS:
•	The mathematical key that controls your cryptocurrency
•	Complete access to everything in your wallet
•	Permanent and unchangeable
•	The ONLY thing standing between you and total loss
Think of it this way:
Your seed phrase is like the combination to a vault containing all your money. Except:
•	There’s no bank manager who knows it
•	There’s no “forgot combination” option
•	There’s no way to change it once created
•	Anyone with the combination can empty the vault
•	There are no security cameras or guards
If someone has your seed phrase, they have your money. 
Not “might have access to.” Not “could potentially steal.” They HAVE it. It’s already gone. You just don’t know it yet.
This is why the #1 rule of crypto is simple:
NEVER share your seed phrase with ANYONE not even the owners of the wallet app. Ever. For any reason.
If someone asks for it—whether they’re claiming to be support, a friend, a developer, an investor, or literally anyone else—it’s a scam. No exceptions. No gray areas. No special circumstances.
What Your Seed Phrase Actually Looks Like
So you know what to protect:
A seed phrase is typically:
•	12 words (Bitcoin, Ethereum, most wallets)
•	24 words (some hardware wallets like Ledger)
•	Random words from a standardized list (like “abandon,” “ability,” “able,” etc.)
•	In a specific order (changing the order = different wallet)
Example (NOT a real seed phrase, don’t use this) a 12-letter seed phrase will appear like this:
witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least 
These words:
•	Generate your private keys mathematically
•	Can recreate your wallet on any device
•	Are the ONLY way to recover your wallet if you lose access
•	Cannot be changed or reset
If you lose them: Your crypto is gone forever. If someone else gets them: Your crypto is gone immediately.
There’s no middle ground. No recovery service. No customer support that can help. No “undo” button. However, even with these conditions governing wallets someone will claim that they can retrieve the seed. Do not fall for it, by the time they are done, you will have spent thousands and no seed.
The Golden Rules: What You NEVER Share
Let’s be crystal clear about what information you must NEVER give to anyone:
1. Your Seed Phrase (Recovery Phrase)
It is also called:
•	Recovery phrase
•	Secret phrase
•	Backup phrase
•	Mnemonic phrase
•	12-word phrase / 24-word phrase
NEVER share this with:
•	“Customer support” (in DMs, emails, or calls)
•	“Technical support” from any wallet or exchange
•	“Developers” claiming to help
•	“Investors” or “advisors”
•	Friends or family (with rare inheritance exceptions)
•	Websites asking you to “verify” or “validate”
•	Apps claiming to “import” or “restore”
•	Anyone, anywhere, for any reason
SAFER ways of using it:
•	Writing it down on paper when creating wallet (offline)
•	Entering it yourself when restoring wallet on new device
•	Storing it in a secure, offline location
•	Inheritance planning (secured, not shared casually)
2. Your Private Keys
What they are:
•	Long strings of letters and numbers (like: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb)
•	Generated from your seed phrase
•	Each cryptocurrency type has its own private key
•	Give complete control of that specific asset
NEVER share this with:
•	Anyone claiming they need it to “send you crypto”
•	Websites asking you to “import” your key
•	Apps requiring it to “connect” your wallet
•	Support asking to “verify” ownership
SAFER uses (ONLY):
•	Importing into a wallet app you control
•	Moving funds between wallets you own
•	Advanced users: signing transactions manually
3. Your Wallet Password
What it is:
•	The password you create when setting up a wallet app
•	Unlocks the wallet app on THAT device only
•	Different from your seed phrase
•	Can be changed (on that device)
Important distinction:
•	Wallet password = locks the app on your phone/computer
•	Seed phrase = controls the actual cryptocurrency
NEVER share this with:
•	Anyone claiming to be support
•	Websites or apps asking for it
•	Anyone who DMs you
Why it matters less than seed phrase:
•	It only protects access to the app, not the crypto itself
•	If someone has your seed phrase, your wallet password doesn’t matter
•	Still, don’t share it—it’s part of your security
What Legitimate Services Actually Ask For
So what CAN you safely share?
Here’s what real, legitimate crypto services might ask for:
SAFE to Share:
1. Your Public Wallet Address
•	Looks like: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
•	Safe to share publicly
•	Anyone can send crypto TO this address
•	Cannot be used to take crypto FROM your wallet
•	Think of it like your email address—public, but can’t access your inbox
When to share:
•	Receiving cryptocurrency from someone
•	Providing to an exchange for withdrawals
•	Posting for donations
•	Sharing on social media (if you want)
2. Transaction ID (TXID) or Transaction Hash
•	Looks like: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t1u2v3w4x5y6z
•	Proves a transaction happened
•	Shows on blockchain explorers
•	Cannot be used to steal funds
When to share:
•	Proving you sent/received payment
•	Troubleshooting with legitimate support
•	Disputes with exchanges
3. Screenshots of Errors (WITH CAUTION)
•	Can help real support diagnose issues
•	BUT: Blur or hide any visible seed phrases, private keys, or balances
•	Show only the error message itself
When to share:
•	Legitimate support tickets on official platforms
•	Community forums when seeking help
•	Only after verifying you’re on official channels
4. KYC (Know Your Customer) Documents
•	Government ID (passport, driver’s license)
•	Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)
•	Selfie for identity verification
When to share:
•	ONLY on verified, legitimate exchange platforms
•	During account setup or verification
•	Never via DM, email, or unsolicited requests
•	Always verify you’re on the real website first
Common Phishing Tactics (And How to Spot Them)
Scammers are sophisticated. Here’s how they operate:
Tactic #1: Fake Support DMs
How it works:
•	You post in a public forum: “My wallet won’t sync”
•	Minutes later, you get a DM: “Hello! I’m from [Wallet] support. I can help you.”
•	They ask you to verify your account by providing your seed phrase
•	Or they send a link to a fake “support portal”
Red flags:
•	Real support NEVER DMs you first
•	They ask for seed phrase or private keys
•	They create urgency (“Your account will be locked!”)
•	Grammar errors, generic greetings
•	Profile created recently
What to do:
•	Ignore and block immediately
•	Report to platform moderators
•	Find official support through the wallet’s official website
•	Post publicly asking for help (real support will respond there)
Real example from my experience: I posted in a Trust Wallet Telegram group asking about a transaction delay. Within 2 minutes, I had 3 DMs from “Trust Wallet Support” with official-looking logos. All asked for my seed phrase to “verify the issue.” All were scammers. Real Trust Wallet support never DMed me – they responded in the public group instead.
Tactic #2: Fake Wallet Apps
How it works:
•	You search “MetaMask” in app store
•	You download “MetaMask Wallet Pro” or “MetaMask - Crypto Wallet”
•	It looks identical to the real app
•	You enter your seed phrase to “import” your wallet
•	Your funds disappear
Red flags:
•	Slightly different name (“Pro,” “Official,” “Secure,” etc.)
•	Different developer name
•	Fewer reviews or suspiciously perfect reviews
•	Not listed on the official wallet website
What to do:
•	ALWAYS go to the official website first (metamask.io, trustwallet.com, etc.)
•	Download ONLY from links on their official site
•	Verify developer name matches official documentation
•	Check number of downloads (real apps have millions)
•	Read recent reviews for scam warnings
Tactic #3: Phishing Websites
How it works:
•	You search “MetaMask” on Google
•	You click the first result (which is an ad)
•	The URL is metamask-secure.com (NOT metamask.io)
•	The website looks IDENTICAL to the real one
•	You download the fake wallet or enter your seed phrase
•	Your funds are stolen
Red flags:
•	URL is slightly different (one letter off, extra words, different domain)
•	Shows up as an ad in search results
•	Asks you to “validate” or “verify” your wallet
•	Requires seed phrase input before downloading
What to do:
•	Manually type the official URL (don’t click search results)
•	Bookmark the real site after verifying it
•	Check for HTTPS and padlock icon (but scammers can fake this too)
•	Verify domain matches official documentation
•	Look for tiny differences (metamask.io vs metamask.com vs metamask-wallet.com)
Common fake domains:
•	Real: metamask.io → Fake: metamask.com, metamask-wallet.io, metamask-secure.com
•	Real: trustwallet.com → Fake: trustwallet.io, trust-wallet.com, trustwalletapp.com
•	Real: ledger.com → Fake: ledger-wallet.com, ledgerlive.com, ledger.io
Tactic #4: Email Phishing
How it works:
•	You receive an email from “support@metamask.com”
•	Subject: “Urgent: Your wallet requires verification”
•	The email claims your wallet will be locked unless you verify
•	You click the link and enter your seed phrase
•	Your funds are gone
Red flags:
•	Creates urgency or fear (“locked,” “suspended,” “compromised”)
•	Asks you to click a link to “verify”
•	Requests seed phrase or private keys
•	Sender email doesn’t match official domain (check carefully!)
•	Grammar errors, generic greetings (“Dear user”)
What to do:
•	Never click links in crypto-related emails
•	Go directly to the official website yourself
•	Check if there are any real notifications there
•	Forward suspicious emails to official support
•	Most wallets DON’T send unsolicited emails
Real example: I received an email claiming to be from Binance: “Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. Verify immediately.” The sender was support@binance-secure.com (NOT @binance.com). The link went to a fake Binance site. I ignored it, went to the real Binance.com and logged in – no issues. It was a phishing attempt.
Tactic #5: “Verification” Pop-ups
How it works:
•	You’re browsing crypto sites or using a DApp
•	A pop-up appears: “Your wallet connection has expired. Re-verify your wallet.”
•	You click to “verify”
•	A window asks you to enter your seed phrase
•	Your wallet is drained
Red flags:
•	Unexpected pop-ups asking for seed phrase
•	Claims wallet is “disconnected” or “expired”
•	Appears while you’re browsing (not initiated by you)
•	Different website URL than what you’re actually on
What to do:
•	NEVER enter seed phrase in pop-ups
•	Close the pop-up immediately
•	Refresh the page or close browser
•	Scan your computer for malware
•	Reconnect wallet manually if needed (real wallets use “Connect” button, not seed phrase)
Tactic #6: Discord/Telegram Admin Impersonation
How it works:
•	You join a crypto project’s Discord server
•	You ask a question in the chat
•	Someone with an “Admin” or “Moderator” badge DMs you
•	They offer to help but need your seed phrase to “check your wallet”
•	It’s not a real admin—it’s a scammer with a similar username
Red flags:
•	DMs you first (real admins respond in public channels)
•	Username is slightly different from real admin
•	Asks for seed phrase or private keys
•	Directs you to external websites
•	Creates urgency
What to do:
•	Check their actual role in the server (click their profile)
•	Compare username EXACTLY to official admin list
•	Ask in the public channel: “Is this person really an admin?”
•	Real admins will confirm publicly, scammers will disappear
•	Report the fake account to server moderators
A Real-World Example: A Scam I’ve Seen (And Fallen For)
Let me share some from my personal experience:
The NOBU Dusting Attack
After doing some tasks and some referrals, I earned myself NOBU Tokens on a Telegram bot and I withdrew 4,000 NOBU tokens straight to my Trust Wallet. I was excited and wanted to have the dollars immediately. Swapping the tokens was my next move.
They even provided a website from where you can swap your NOBU tokens for USDT (BEP-20): https://nobuonbsc.com. All I needed to do was:
1.	Pay about $6 gas fee (from my BNB coins) to approve the swap
2.	The tokens would convert to real USDT
$6 was deducted from my wallet. The swap never happened. Instead, I got a message: “Send $3 to complete the transaction.”
That’s when I realized: I’d just paid scammers $6 to learn what a dusting attack looks like.
Those 4,000 NOBU tokens are still sitting in my wallet. Worthless. Unswappable. A permanent reminder. Maybe this piece will remind these people that they owe me my money for a swap that never happened. I would really be glad if they contacted me.
The lesson: If you withdraw tokens such as these into your wallet, try to use established swap platforms such as Pancakeswap. Don’t use the website provided by the owners of the tokens. Don’t try to swap them. They were sent to trick you into paying fees or approving malicious contracts.
How to Spot Fakes: Your Verification Checklist
Before trusting ANY crypto-related contact, website, or app:
For Websites:
•	Is the URL EXACTLY correct? (Not one letter off)
•	Did I type it manually or use a bookmarked link? (Don’t trust search results)
•	Does it have HTTPS and a padlock? (But remember: scammers can fake this)
•	Does it match the official website listed on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko?
•	Are there any typos or grammar errors on the page?
For Apps:
•	Did I download from a link on the official website?
•	Is the developer name correct? (Check official documentation)
•	Are there millions of downloads? (Real apps have high numbers)
•	Are recent reviews positive or warning about scams?
•	Does the app name match EXACTLY? (No “Pro,” “Secure,” “Official” additions)
For DMs/Messages:
•	Did they contact me first? (Red flag if yes)
•	Are they asking for seed phrase, private keys, or wallet password? (100% scam if yes)
•	Do they create urgency? (“Act now!” “24 hours!” “Locked!”)
•	Is their username EXACTLY the same as official accounts?
•	Can I verify they’re real by asking in official public channels?
For Emails:
•	Is the sender domain EXACTLY correct? (Not similar, but exact)
•	Did I expect this email? (Unsolicited = suspicious)
•	Does it ask me to click links or download files?
•	Can I verify this by going to the official website directly?
•	Does it create fear or urgency?
When in doubt: DON’T. Go to the official website yourself and check.
What to Do If You’ve Been Compromised
If you’ve already shared your seed phrase, private keys, or clicked a suspicious link:
Immediate Actions:
1. Create a New Wallet Immediately
•	Download a fresh wallet app from official source
•	Generate a NEW seed phrase
•	Do NOT reuse the compromised one
2. Transfer Any Remaining Funds
•	Move everything to your new wallet ASAP
•	Even if you don’t see theft yet, assume it’s coming
•	Better safe than sorry
3. Disconnect Compromised Wallet from All DApps
•	Go to sites like revoke.cash (Ethereum) or bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker (BSC)
•	Revoke all permissions from the compromised wallet
•	This prevents further unauthorized transactions
4. Document Everything
•	Screenshot the scam message, website, or email
•	Note the scammer’s username, website URL, or email
•	Record transaction hashes if funds were stolen
Do This Next:
Report to:
•	The platform where the scam occurred (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etc.)
•	The legitimate service that was impersonated (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
•	Federal Trade Commission (FTC): reportfraud.ftc.gov
•	Better Business Bureau Scam Tracker: bbb.org/scamtracker
•	Local law enforcement (if significant amount lost)
•	Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): ic3.gov
Why report:
•	Helps warn others
•	Creates a record for authorities
•	May help shut down scam operations
•	Provides data for consumer protection
Damage Control:
What you CAN recover:
•	Funds still in your wallet (move them immediately)
•	Access to new wallets (create fresh ones)
•	Knowledge (learn from the mistake)
What you CANNOT recover:
•	Funds already stolen (blockchain transactions are irreversible)
•	The compromised wallet (once seed phrase is exposed, it’s permanently unsafe)
•	Money paid to scammers
Hard truth: If cryptocurrency has already been transferred out of your wallet, it’s gone. There’s no bank to reverse the transaction. No customer service to refund you. No insurance to reimburse you. This is why prevention is everything.
Learning and Moving Forward:
After a compromise:
•	Acknowledge what happened (don’t beat yourself up)
•	Understand exactly how the scam worked
•	Identify what red flag you missed
•	Share your story to help others (anonymously if you prefer)
•	Rebuild with better security practices
I’ve lost money to scams. I’ve made mistakes. Each one taught me something expensive but valuable. You’re not alone, and you’re not stupid—scammers are professionals who exploit psychology, not intelligence.
Protective Habits: Your Daily Security Routine
Make these habits automatic:
Never Click Links in DMs
•	If someone sends a link, ignore it
•	Go to the official website yourself
•	Verify independently
Always Verify URLs Manually
•	Type websites yourself
•	Bookmark official sites
•	Don’t trust search results or ads
Enable 2FA Everywhere Possible
•	Exchanges: Use 2FA (Google Authenticator, not SMS)
•	Email: Enable 2FA
•	Discord/Telegram: Enable 2FA
•	Layer security everywhere
Use Hardware Wallets for Large Amounts
•	If you have significant crypto ($1000+), consider Ledger or Trezor
•	Hardware wallets keep seed phrases offline
•	Much harder to compromise remotely
•	(We’ll cover this in detail in a future article)
Keep Seed Phrase Offline Always
•	Never on computer, phone, cloud, email
•	Paper or metal backup only
•	Secured in physical location
•	Never photographed
Question Everything
•	If it seems urgent, it’s probably a scam
•	If it sounds too good to be true, it is
•	If they contacted you first, be suspicious
•	If they ask for seed phrase, it’s 100% a scam
Special Note: When Family/Friends Ask for Your Seed Phrase
Sometimes well-meaning people give bad advice:
“Just give me your seed phrase and I’ll help you set it up.” “Send me your recovery phrase so I can check if it’s correct.” “Let me import your wallet on my computer to troubleshoot.”
Even if they mean well, the answer is NO.
Why:
•	They could accidentally expose it
•	Their device could be compromised
•	They could lose it or write it down insecurely
•	If they get hacked, your crypto is gone too
Instead:
•	Offer to screen-share while YOU enter it
•	Walk them through steps without revealing it
•	Create a test wallet to practice together
•	Teach them why it’s secret, even from you
Exception: Inheritance Planning This is the ONLY valid reason to share your seed phrase – and even then, it should be:
•	Sealed in an envelope
•	Stored in a safe or safety deposit box
•	With clear instructions
•	With trusted legal executor
•	Not casually shared
The Bottom Line: Trust No One, Verify Everything
In crypto, paranoia is smart.
•	Real support doesn’t DM first
•	Real apps don’t ask for seed phrases
•	Real websites match official URLs exactly
•	Real opportunities don’t create urgency
•	Real help happens in public channels
If you would remember nothing else, at least remember this:
Your seed phrase is worth everything in your wallet. Treat it like $1 million in cash.
Would you hand $1 million to a stranger who DMed you on Discord? Would you type $1 million into a website you found through a Google ad? Would you email $1 million to “support” who contacted you?
Of course not. So don’t do it with your seed phrase either.
