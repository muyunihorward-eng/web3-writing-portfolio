The numbers tell a stark story about traditional banking in Zambia. Despite decades of financial sector development, only 15 to 20 percent of Zambians have formal bank accounts. This means that roughly 80 to 85 percent of the population – millions of people – remain excluded from traditional banking services. In rural areas, the nearest bank branch might be hundreds of kilometers away. Even in urban centers like Lusaka, opening a bank account requires documentation, minimum balances, and bureaucratic hurdles that exclude the poor and informal workers who need financial services most.
Yet this same population has embraced mobile money with remarkable enthusiasm. As of 2024, Zambia recorded 12.9 million active mobile money accounts, with Mobile Network Operators capturing approximately 90 percent of the financial services market and processing K486 billion in transaction values. While over 58.5 percent of Zambian adults use mobile money services, they remain locked out of formal banking. Approximately 90 percent of deposit accounts that do exist hold balances below K50,000, highlighting how traditional banks have failed to serve the majority.
This gap between mobile money adoption and formal banking access reveals something crucial: Zambians want and can use digital financial services when those services are accessible, affordable, and don't require the gatekeeping that traditional banks impose. Mobile money succeeded precisely because it bypassed bank branches, credit checks, and minimum balance requirements.
Enter blockchain technology and cryptocurrency – digital solutions promising to take the mobile money revolution further by offering not just payments, but savings, credit, insurance, and investment opportunities without traditional banking infrastructure. But can crypto truly deliver financial inclusion where banks have failed, or is this just another overhyped technology that will leave Africa's poor behind?
The Banking Gap That Crypto Claims to Fill
The financial exclusion problem in Africa is not merely about access to ATMs or bank branches. It's fundamentally about trust, cost, and infrastructure. Traditional banks require physical infrastructure, regulatory compliance, credit histories, and identification documents that many Africans simply don't have. The cost structure of conventional banking makes serving low-income customers unprofitable, creating a vicious cycle where those who need financial services most are systematically excluded.
Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology propose a radically different model. With just a smartphone and internet connection, anyone can access financial services without intermediaries, credit checks, or minimum balance requirements. Transactions are peer-to-peer, costs are theoretically lower, and the system operates 24/7 without bank holidays or business hours.
Real Examples: Where Crypto Is Making a Difference
The promise of crypto-based financial inclusion is no longer purely theoretical. Across Africa, several initiatives demonstrate how blockchain technology is reaching populations that traditional banks have ignored.
In Kenya, ETHERISC partnered with ACRE Africa to provide blockchain-based crop insurance to over 17,000 smallholder farmers. These farmers, who would never qualify for traditional insurance products, now have protection against extreme weather events through smart contracts that automatically trigger payouts when adverse conditions are detected. No paperwork, no claims adjusters, no months-long waiting periods – just automated, transparent, and immediate assistance when disaster strikes.
Mercy Corps Ventures' Crypto for Good Fund has deployed multiple projects across East Africa that showcase the versatility of blockchain for financial inclusion. In Kenya, they've implemented stablecoin micropayments for digital workers who previously struggled with international payment barriers. In Uganda, they've developed digital identity solutions for refugees who lack traditional documentation but need to participate in the economy. Perhaps most innovatively, in Mozambique, they've explored NFT sales to finance affordable housing – turning real estate into accessible digital assets.
The payments infrastructure is also being rebuilt on blockchain rails. BitPesa, now known as AZA Finance, pioneered blockchain-based remittances from Kenya, dramatically reducing transaction costs for cross-border money transfers. The Stellar Development Foundation has launched a cross-African payment app serving Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda, while the Celo Foundation introduced a CFA franc stablecoin to facilitate payments across West Africa without exposure to volatile cryptocurrencies.
These examples share common threads: they target real problems, they reduce costs, and they eliminate intermediaries who have historically extracted value while providing minimal service to the poor.
The Zambian Context: Why Uptake Remains Slow
Despite these promising examples from our neighbors, Zambia's blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption for financial inclusion remains minimal. Yet paradoxically, Zambia is home to at least one thriving bitcoin mining operation. Gridless, a Kenya-based company, operates a remote mining facility at the Zengamina hydro-power plant, powered by the Zambezi River. Each mining machine earns around $5 a day, with the operation remaining profitable even when bitcoin prices drop, thanks to affordable, clean energy and a revenue-sharing deal with the local power provider.
This mining operation represents a fascinating contradiction: Zambia has the infrastructure and energy resources to support commercial cryptocurrency operations, yet ordinary Zambians struggle to use crypto for basic financial services. The disconnect highlights that barriers to crypto adoption for financial inclusion are not purely technical—they're regulatory, educational, and structural.
Understanding why requires examining the specific barriers facing Zambian adoption beyond infrastructure.
The regulatory environment is the most obvious obstacle. The Bank of Zambia has explicitly warned the public against using cryptocurrencies, stating they are not recognized as legal tender and are not regulated by the government. While possession and trading of crypto are not explicitly illegal, the government and regulatory bodies have discouraged their use and implemented strict measures against crypto transactions through regulated financial institutions. This creates uncertainty for anyone considering serious cryptocurrency adoption for business or financial inclusion purposes.
However, to be fair to regulators, caution is not necessarily obstructionism. In 2023, Technology and Science Minister Felix Mutati announced that Zambia is testing blockchain-based technology to regulate cryptocurrency. The Bank of Zambia, working with the Securities Exchange Commission and DLTLedgers, is developing a framework that balances innovation with citizen protection. According to Vision 2027, the central bank aims to align Zambia's National Payment System with global trends while ensuring that regulation enables rather than constrains innovation. Vitalik Buterin's February 2023 visit to Lusaka, where he met with presidential advisors and Minister of Finance Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane, signals that there is high-level interest in exploring crypto's potential responsibly.
Beyond regulation, infrastructure challenges loom large. Reliable internet access remains inconsistent outside major urban areas, and electricity supply – essential for maintaining digital wallets and conducting transactions – is increasingly unreliable even in Lusaka due to ongoing load shedding. Africa hosts 75 percent of the world's population without access to electricity, and Zambia's energy crisis only exacerbates this fundamental barrier to digital financial inclusion.
Digital literacy is another critical gap. According to Gemini's 2022 Global State of Crypto report, 40 percent of African respondents cited lack of understanding as a reason for not buying crypto, with 56 percent stating that more educational resources would make them more comfortable purchasing digital assets. In Zambia, where blockchain and cryptocurrency remain poorly understood even among educated urbanites, scaling adoption to rural populations would require massive educational investment.
Data costs remain prohibitively high relative to incomes across Africa, including Zambia. Even when people have smartphones and internet access, the cost of data for conducting regular cryptocurrency transactions can be significant for someone earning minimal income. High implementation costs and transaction fees further limit the practical utility of blockchain solutions for poverty alleviation.
Despite official discouragement, there is evidence of a growing underground crypto market in Zambia. Peer-to-peer trading platforms are seeing increased activity, particularly among younger demographics who view cryptocurrencies as a way to participate in the global digital economy and hedge against Kwacha depreciation. A 2024 survey by a global fintech firm found that approximately 12 percent of Zambians have engaged in some form of cryptocurrency transaction despite legal barriers – a small but notable percentage given the risks and obstacles involved.
The Verdict: Promise with Caveats
Can cryptocurrency provide financial inclusion where banks have failed in Africa? The evidence suggests a qualified yes – but only under specific conditions and with realistic expectations.
Blockchain technology genuinely solves some problems that have made traditional banking inaccessible to the poor. It reduces costs, eliminates gatekeepers, enables cross-border transactions, and creates financial services that don't require physical infrastructure. The Kenyan farmers with crop insurance, Ugandan refugees with digital identities, and digital workers receiving stablecoin payments are not hypothetical beneficiaries - they're real people whose lives have materially improved through blockchain-based financial inclusion.
However, crypto is not a silver bullet. It cannot magically solve infrastructure deficits, create internet access where none exists, or generate electricity to power smartphones. It cannot replace the need for digital literacy or make data costs affordable. Most importantly, it cannot succeed without sensible regulation that protects consumers while enabling innovation.
For Zambia specifically, the path forward requires addressing these fundamentals. The government's cautious approach to regulation is actually appropriate – rushing into cryptocurrency adoption without proper frameworks, as some countries have done, has led to scams, losses, and disillusionment. But caution must be balanced with openness to innovation.
The testing and regulatory development currently underway, combined with high-level engagement evidenced by Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin's visit, suggests Zambia may be positioning itself to adopt blockchain technology thoughtfully rather than reactively. If the regulatory framework being developed creates clarity without stifling innovation, if infrastructure investments improve internet and electricity access, and if educational initiatives increase digital literacy, then cryptocurrency could indeed provide financial inclusion to Zambians that traditional banks have failed to serve.
The question is not whether crypto can work for financial inclusion in Africa and Zambia in particular – we already know it can. The question is whether Zambia will create the conditions necessary for it to work here. The technology is ready. The question is whether we are.
